## Creating a new project with JS

1. Add a directory to `content/projects` with index.html

2. The template will look for a `main.js` in the same folder and load that as a script


## Styling

Ananke uses [Tachyon.io](https://tachyons.io/) utility class library.


## TODO

- Optimise charts.js loading
