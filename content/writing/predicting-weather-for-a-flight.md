I've just got my PPL after just over a year of studying and the biggest take away I have is that the British weather is unpredictable. It'd be okay if I could just look out my window, see a good day for flying and just hop in the plane and fly, but few pilots get that luxury! I've had to hone my predictive skills when it comes to planning ahead.


## What makes the UK weather so crazy?


- Three air currents on earth (north, equatorial, south) and the UK is right in the middle of one
- Subtropical jetstream lies over UK 
- Air masses move around, due to warming, humidity
- Causes areas of high/low pressure 
- 'Pushes' the jetstream around, which blocks some 'air masses' and allows others through
- Due to the earth spinning anti-clockwise the jetstream moves East

## What to look for when planning a flight


Obviously the weather forecast on the day of the flight will give you the best indication of whether it's safe to fly or not, it's nice to

The Met Office mobile app gives a great pressure [Aviation Briefing Service](https://logon.metoffice.gov.uk/Login?goto=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/premium/myservices/) is free and has the 

- Generally, high pressure is good
- Air moves away (to low pressure) and is replaced by air from above, which forces warm air downwards.
- If the air is moist then it can bring rain

Pressure highs and lows often direct the jetstream, blocking fronts and, due to the cyclone and anticyclone directions, can change the wind direction.

- Fronts bring rain usually, but cold fronts are worse

- Warm air rises, creates instability (especially if humid)
