*Career*

- Enjoying the challenge of managing people (but my team make it easy)
- Have mostly been working on the same project (faster switching) for over a year now so looking forward to that going live July 2022!


*Life*:

- Have been lazy with this blog and other side projects, but this is me getting back into it!
- The news has been rather depressing recently, but still check every day to cheer Ukraine on! I feel this will be something we remember for a long time to come.
- Flew to Duxford with harriet the other day, a great day out and feeling really confident now.


*Eating*: 

- Started a veg delivery service in Jan but starting to lag on that. So much veg and we struggle to use it all sometimes!


*Watching*: 

- The Apprentice (of course)
- Love is blind - the guilty pleasure
- The Office (UK version)


*Listening*: 

- Have gotten most of the way through Stevie Wonder's discography, there's a lot!
- I'm listening to High Road by Sir Woman on repeat
