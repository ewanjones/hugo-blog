    I was recently looking at buying a second hand car and it got me wondering, what is the best 
    car you can buy?  I assume it must be some function of price vs 'quality', the only issue is 
    defining the latter. Whilst searching, it seem to be mainly about newer cars with less 
    mileage on them and cost less in tax and insurance per year, so let's start with that.
