    This is an experimental page playing with piping statics into webpages using Hugo. This page uses
    charts.js written in ES6 javascript (which wouldn't work in a browser) but is transformed before
    rendering. Also, the data comes from a JSON file in the data directory and it fetched in the 
    template using a shortcode. 

    <br><br>

    See the source code {{< staticlink "main.js" "here" >}}.This is actually piped into my content
    file with a shortcode, as getting resources is not available in content files, only templates.

    <br><br>

    I promise there'll be more exciting stuff here soon.

    I was recently looking at buying a second hand car and it got me wondering, what is the best 
    car you can buy?  I assume it must be some function of price vs 'quality', the only issue is 
    defining the latter. Whilst searching, it seem to be mainly about newer cars with less 
    mileage on them and cost less in tax and insurance per year, so let's start with that.
