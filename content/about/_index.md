I'm a full-stack developer able to build web applications from scratch. I love solving complex problems in innovative ways. I want to use my skills to make the world a better place.

I first picked up coding during my Biomedical Sciences degree studying bioinformatics, and have been addicted to making cool things that people can use ever since.
