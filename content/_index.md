I'm a software developer currently working at [Octopus Energy](https://octopus.energy) to help make the world a greener place.

I consider myself a nerd who loves learning new things, and this blog is (hopefully) a place for me to record some of that knowledge.

I don't expect this blog to be seen by many people, so if you're reading this - **thanks**!
