I'm a software developer currently working at [Octopus Energy](https://octopus.energy) to help make the world a greener place.

I'm a bit of a nerd who loves learning new things, and the site is mainly a place for me to publish thoughts and opinions in this little corner of the internet.

I don't expect this blog to be seen by many people, so if you're reading this - **thanks**!
